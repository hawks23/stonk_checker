      "Formatting Python in VS Code\n",
      "============================\n",
      "\n",
      "Formatting makes source code easier to read by human beings. By enforcing particular rules and conventions such as line spacing, indents, and spacing around operators, the code becomes more visually organized and comprehensible. You can view an example on the [autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/) page. Keep in mind, formatting doesn't affect the functionality of the code itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Linting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting) helps to prevent errors by analyzing code for common syntactical, stylistic, and functional errors and unconventional programming practices. Although there is a little overlap between formatting and linting, the two capabilities are complementary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Choose a formatter\n",
      "------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Search the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) for the formatter extension of your choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft publishes the following formatting extensions:\n",
      "\n",
      "| Formatter | Extension |\n",
      "| --- | --- |\n",
      "| autopep8 | [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.autopep8](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.autopep8) |\n",
      "| Black formatter | [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter) |\n",
      "\n",
      "Formatter extensions offered by the community:\n",
      "\n",
      "| Formatter | Extension |\n",
      "| --- | --- |\n",
      "| Ruff | [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff) |\n",
      "| yapf | [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eeyore.yapf](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eeyore.yapf) |\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, below are formatter extensions that support import sorting:\n",
      "\n",
      "| Formatter | Extension |\n",
      "| --- | --- |\n",
      "| Ruff | [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff) |\n",
      "| isort | [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.isort](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.isort) |\n",
      "\n",
      "> **Note**: If you don't find your preferred formatter in the table above or in the Marketplace, you can add support for it via an extension. You can use the [Python Extension Template](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/advanced-topics/python-extension-template) to integrate new Python tools into VS Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Set a default formatter\n",
      "-----------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you install a formatter extension, you can select it as the default formatter for Python files in VS Code by following the steps below:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Open a Python file in VS Code.\n",
      "2.  Right-click on the editor to display the context menu.\n",
      "3.  Select **Format Document With...**.\n",
      "4.  Select **Configure Default Formatter...** from the drop-down menu.\n",
      "5.  Select your preferred formatter extension from the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, you can set it as the default formatter for all Python files by setting `\"editor.defaultFormatter\"` in your User `settings.json` file, under a `[python]` scope. You can open `settings.json` with the **Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)** command.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, to set Black Formatter as the default formatter, add the following setting to your User `settings.json` file:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "  \"[python]\": {\n",
      "    \"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"ms-python.black-formatter\"\n",
      "  }\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to set a formatter extension as an import sorter, you can set your preference under `\"editor.codeActionsOnSave\"` in your User `settings.json` file or your Workspace `settings.json` file, under a `[python]` scope. You can open these `settings.json` files using the **Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)** and **Preferences: Open Workspace Settings (JSON)** commands respectively. This will enable import sorting on save for all Python files.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, to set Ruff as your preferred import sorter, you can add the following setting to your User `settings.json` or your Workspace `settings.json` file:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"[python]\": {\n",
      "    \"editor.codeActionsOnSave\": {\n",
      "      \"source.organizeImports.ruff\": \"explicit\"\n",
      "    }\n",
      "  }\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Format your code\n",
      "----------------\n",
      "\n",
      "You can format your code by right-clicking on the editor and selecting **Format Document**, or by using the ⇧⌥F (Windows Shift+Alt+F, Linux Ctrl+Shift+I) keyboard shortcut.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also add the following setting to your User `settings.json` file to enable formatting on save for your code:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "  \"[python]\": {\n",
      "    \"editor.formatOnSave\": true\n",
      "  }\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "General formatting settings\n",
      "---------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "You can refer to each formatter extension's README for more details on the supported settings. The following settings are supported by most formatter extensions:\n",
      "\n",
      "| Setting Suffix  \n",
      " | Default value | Description |\n",
      "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
      "| args | `[]` | Arguments to be passed to the formatter. Each argument should be passed as a separate string in the array.  \n",
      "For example:  \n",
      "`black-formatter.args: [\"--line-length\", \"100\"]` |\n",
      "| importStrategy | `useBundled` | When set to `useBundled`, the extension uses the version of the tool that it ships with. When set to `fromEnvironment`, it attempts to load from your selected Python environment first, otherwise it falls back to the bundled version. |\n",

      "If formatting fails, check the following possible causes:\n",
      "\n",
      "| Problem | Solution |\n",
      "| --- | --- |\n",
      "| There are multiple formatters available for Python files. | Set the default formatter by following the instructions in [the section above](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/formatting#_set-a-default-formatter). |\n",
      "| No \"Format Document With...\" option is available. | If you don't see this option in the context menu, it's likely you don't have a formatter extension installed or enabled in VS Code. Reference the [Choose a Formatter](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/formatting#_choose-a-formatter) section to see how you can install a Python formatter extension. |\n",
      "| Custom arguments for the formatter are incorrect. | Check that the appropriate `<formatter>.path` setting does not contain arguments, and that `<formatter>.args` contains a list of individual top-level argument elements. |\n",
      "| The \"You have deprecated linting or formatting settings\" notification is displayed. | If you are seeing this notification, it means you have settings such as `python.linting` or `python.formatting` in VS Code. These settings are no longer supported by the Python extension, as [linting and formatting support has been migrated to tools extensions](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/wiki/Migration-to-Python-Tools-Extensions). |\n",
      "| The **Format Selection** command fails when using Black Formatter. | `black` does not support formatting sections of code. To work around this limitation, you can disable format on paste and set `formatOnSave` to format the whole file with the following settings: `\"[python]\": {\"editor.formatOnPaste\": false, \"editor.formatOnSaveMode\": \"file\"}`. |\n",
      "| Formatting doesn't work even though I have a formatter extension installed. | Formatting can fail for various reasons, such as syntax issues in your code, an unsupported version of Python is used, or the formatter isn't configured correctly. Check the formatter extension's Output channel to understand why the formatter has failed (run the **Output: Focus on Output** command in the Command Palette, and then select the formatter extension channel). |\n",
      "\n",
      "> **Note**: If you don't find your preferred formatter listed above, you can add support via an extension. The [Python Extension Template](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/advanced-topics/python-extension-template) makes it easy to integrate new Python tools into VS Code.\n",

But recent sentiment among investors has been held hostage by interest-rate obsession, with peaks for stocks on days when the data suggests a cut is needed and valleys on days when rates seem destined to stay high. Indeed, the one-month charts for the major indices are roller coaster in nature. According to Mark Arbeter, Argus\\' Chartered Market Technician, the AAII survey is showing 39% bulls and 32% bears, while the CNN Fear & Greed Index is at 45%. Both show a neutral attitude towards stocks. That\\'s fuel for higher stock prices according to Mark, but we need a catalyst or two to get investors off the sidelines.\\n    \\n    \\xa0[](https://finance.yahoo.com/research/reports/ARGUS_40264_MarketSummary_1718102702000 \"Stocks are at all-time highs and have logged gains at mid-year that would be\")\\nTitle: NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) Stock Price & News -

an investor is willing to buy or sell a stock. The\\u202fbid\\u202fis the highest amount that a buyer is currently willing to pay, whereas the ask\\u202fis the lowest amount that a seller is currently willing to sell. The numbers next to the bid/ask are the “[size](https://www.nasdaq.com/glossary/s/size)”. The bid size displays the total amount of desired shares ...

The data displayed in the quote bar updates every 3 seconds; allowing you to monitor prices in real-time.  \\n  \\nThe\\u202f[bid-ask spread](https://www.nasdaq.com/glossary/b/bid-asked-spread)\\u202fcan indicate a stock’s liquidity, which is how easy it is to buy and sell in the marketplace. Often, a smaller spread suggests higher liquidity, meaning more buyers and sellers in the market are willing to negotiate. In contrast, a larger spread suggests lower liquidity, as there are fewer investors willing to negotiate. You can use the bid-ask spread to determine whether to place a\\u202f [market order](https://www.nasdaq.com/glossary/m/market-order)\\u202for\\u202f[limit order](https://www.nasdaq.com/glossary/l/limit-order)\\u202fwhen trading, helping you to optimize your price and have a successful order execution.  \\n  \\nReal-time bid and ask information is powered by Nasdaq Basic, a premier market data solution.

In 1995, the company brought its first product, a multimedia card, to market. The company’s first big success came a couple years later when the company sold 1 million units of its RIVE 128 processor in the first four months it was sold. A couple years after that, in 1999, the company launches its first graphics processing unit.

Nvidia traded under the ticker NVDA. \\xa0It offered 3.5 million shares in its IPO. Just two years after going public, Nvidia was added the the S&P 500 in 2001. The company was the fastest every semiconductor company to reach $1 billion in revenue. The company continued to grow quickly from there.\\n\\nNvidia stock price hit a then all time high of over $23 in January 2002 but Nvidia stock price dropped dramatically back down to single figures in the same year.\\n\\nWhen, in 2004, the SLI connection standard was released, Nvidia saw a huge bump in the processing power it could achieve on a single machine. It was after 2005 when Nvidia stock price started generating interest and attention but still faced peaks and troughs.\\n\\nPerhaps the most consequential advance in Nvidia’s history was the 2006 launch of the company’s CUDA development platform. The platform allowed the company’s GPUs to be used for more than rendering graphics, and would eventually prove to be one of Nvidia’s biggest advantages in the explosively growing world of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\\n\\nIn 2007, the company achieved its first ever quarter with more than $1 billion in revenue, and was named company of the year by Forbes magazine, Nvidia stock price increased on the news. It was also awarded an Emmy award for the potential it helped unlock in the entertainment industry.\\n\\nIn 2015, Nvidia dove head-first into the artificial intelligence space, releasing its first “Drive” chip for autonomous driving in cars, as well as its “Jetson” chip made for embedded computing on smaller AI-powered devices.\\n\\nNvidia reaffirmed its AI prowess in its third quarter earnings report of 2016. Nvidia stock price rose about 30% after the company nearly doubled analyst earnings expectations. The company’s data center business, which is where many of its chips are bought for AI processing, brought in $240 million in revenue in the quarter.\\n\\nNvidia came into a bit of trouble after a report from Citron research at the end of 2016 said the company wasn’t actually gaining new business, just stealing market share from its rival, AMD. Nvidia stock price stock fell by about 7% after the report. Nvidia stock price quickly recovered however, and continued to march higher.\\n\\nIn May of 2017, Nvidia released its Volta architecture of chips, that was such a dramatic increase in computing power that Nvidia stock price shot up about 17%, or $18 in a single day.\\n\\nThe increase in attention placed on artificial intelligence research has provided a huge boost for Nvidia. Since the start of 2016, the company has seen a nearly 400% annual increase in Nvidia stock price. Before 2016, the company saw an annual growth rate just under 20%. Nvidia was named the “Smartest Company in 2017.”\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nMoody’s Daily Credit Risk Score\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nRisk\\n\\n*   Low\\n*   Medium\\n*   High\\n\\n4\\n\\nMoody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score of a company’s credit risk, based on an analysis of the firm’s balance sheet and inputs from the stock market.
